Crucible
================

Accurate, reasonably scalable alignment of fragments to reference alignments. An implementation of [WITCH](https://github.com/c5shen/WITCH), useful when:

 - sequences with a lot of fragments need to be aligned (in other words, accurate MSA estimation under sequence length heterogeneity)
 - aligning fragments to an existing reference alignment (for phylogenetic placement, etc.)

## Quick start

Install WITCH first.
